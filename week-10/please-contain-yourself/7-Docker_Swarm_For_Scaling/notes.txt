- Do what that guy do with the hello container -include that video as a resource if they want to go indepth with using nginx for load balancing
- also include that really cool video with worker nodes and the voting app. I want to know how to build a repo that can just be deployed and scaled that easily!!!

- Do what that guy do with the hello container 
- have them download your image that spins up a server of something unique each time
- have them swarm it and them visit the page and refreash several times to demonstrate the automatic load balancing. or use curl like he did if refreshing doesnt work
- 
- cluster, swarm, swarm-cluster?

- use the voting app?

scale the polling app with the compose scale command

then use swarm to scale the voting app
