# To-Do List Application

Done in pair programming with Aileen Ocampo

## Standard Requirements:
- [x] An input at the top where a user can input their username and click "Submit Username"
- [x] "Welcome, ____!" should appear on the screen with the user's name in the blank after they've submitted their name
- [x] A box where a user can input a new to do item (there is no limit to how many they may add) that says "Add!"
- [x] An option to "complete" which will delete the item from the screen that says "Delete!"
- [x] A "Finish All" button that would remove all items from the list

## Advanced Requirements:
- [x] Style! Select fonts, colors, backgrounds, and images that make this look good and professional
- [ ] Make the data persist if the page is refreshed
- [ ] Provide an input field for "category" that will allow the user to assign a category to each to do item (For example: "Yard Work" and the to do items in that category might be "Weeding" and "Mowing the lawn")
- [ ] Add a gif for when someone clicks "Finish All" to pop up and congratulate them on their list being completed

## Nightmare Mode Requirements:
- [ ] Deploy this app to Heroku
- [ ] Research React Hooks and attempt to implement at least 1 hook in this application
- [ ] Add Context to your application

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
