## Instructions
To run a particular file, please first note whether the folder contains package.json files. Folders with package.json files require you to execute ```npm install``` at the root of each folder (e.g. ```cd ./frontend & npm install && cd ../backend & npm install```). Be sure to read the scripts within the package.json (or README.md where available) to execute the necessary commands for installing and running the application. If there are no package.json or README.md files, and only .js files, just execute ```node <filename here>``` to run the code.
