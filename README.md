## Instructions
To run a particular file, please first note whether the folder the files are stored in contain a package.json. Folders with a package.json require you to execute ```npm install``` at the root of the project. After that, follow the scripts within the package.json to execute the necessary commands for running the application. If there is no package.json, and only .js files, just execute ```node <filename here>``` to test the scripts.
